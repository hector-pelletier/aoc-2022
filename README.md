# Advent of Code 2022 | OCaml

Here are my solutions for the 2022 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

This year, I'll be trying out [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/). I am using version *4.02* of the language, mainly because it is the one that was installed on my laptop. 
This comes with minor annoyances:
  - No standard `string -> char list` conversion, nor the other way around.
  - No access to the `Seq` module, which would provide various useful iteration tools.
All of those are not primordial and ultimately I chose simplicity in not changing my already exisant setup.
